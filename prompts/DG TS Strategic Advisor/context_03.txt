# DG TS MVP — Required Proto Files

1. Core Trading
* order.proto — defines the canonical order (limit/market, IDs, timestamp, state).
* order_book.proto — tracks order book snapshots and events (add, cancel, match).
* matching.proto — deterministic matching engine output for trades; seed-based replayable decisions.
* trade.proto — executed trade object with immutable IDs, timestamp, quantity, price.

2. Participant / Counterparty
* participant.proto — trader profile, basic risk limits, status (active/inactive).
* account.proto — balances, basic margin info for MVP.

3. Admin / Governance
* admin.proto — emergency kill switch, basic feature flags, system control operations.

4. Telemetry / Audit
* telemetry.proto — critical event logging: order creation/cancellation, trade execution, system errors.
* audit.proto — minimal audit trail for compliance and replayability (MVP can combine telemetry + audit if needed).

5. Common / Shared
* common.proto — enums, IDs, timestamps, state constants, shared types across services.
