# DG TS — Continuous Double Auction Matching Engine

Project Overview
DG TS is an open-source platform modeling the canonical electronic exchange core underlying modern venues such as NASDAQ, MICEX, CME, and leading Alternative Trading Systems. It implements a continuous double auction at its core, providing a canonical abstraction of market physics, where agents act as strategic controllers, and market prices emerge endogenously from equilibrium-seeking interactions under explicit constraints.

DG TS is not a clone of any specific exchange. Instead, it is a production-grade, configurable foundation for building high-performance trading systems and marketplaces.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Launch

Start the full system with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Version 0.1 — Core Features

* Participant registration: onboarding traders with identity verification.
* Order submission: limit and market orders, fully validated against risk and margin rules.
* Order book visualization: live display of active orders and market depth.
* Matching algorithm: deterministic, canonical continuous double auction engine.
* Trade lifecycle management: explicit FSM states (PENDING → EXECUTED → SETTLED / CANCELLED).
* Admin panel: basic control, monitoring, and emergency kill switch.
* REST + WebSocket APIs: real-time order updates, market data streaming.
* Telemetry and dashboards: Golden path monitoring, Prometheus + Grafana, and open API endpoints for system status.
* ML data collection: structured logging for drift detection, prediction, and liquidity modeling.
* Risk management: enforce invariants (e.g., one active order per participant per instrument, margin limits, and systemic exposure).

## Architecture & Technology Stack

* High-performance components (matching, routing): C++ with gRPC
* API Gateway: Python FastAPI, enforcing idempotency, audit logs, and compliance checks
* Admin Panel: React.js, integrated with MapLibre for visualization
* Geographical & spatial data: PostGIS, OpenStreetMap (OSM) vector tiles, TileServer GL
* Routing engine: Valhalla for real-world geospatial routing (if modeling logistics)
* Real-time updates: WebSocket for live order book, trade, and participant state streaming
* API Contracts: protobuf-first design; `.proto` files are the single source of truth
* Trip / Order FSM: explicit state machine per domain object
* Analytics & ML: ClickHouse used solely for telemetry, analytics, and ML pipelines
* Monitoring: local Prometheus + Grafana dashboards for latency, throughput, trade execution, and system health metrics

### Notes on Design Philosophy

* Deterministic, replayable algorithms ensure auditability and compliance.
* Kill switches and risk controls are embedded throughout the stack to safely pause or throttle trading activity.
* Every state transition and decision is logged for traceability and post-event analysis.
* The system is modular, containerized, and designed for high availability and resilience.
