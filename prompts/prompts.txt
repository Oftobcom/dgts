I’m sending a long context. Do not reply until I write: READY. Just acknowledge received.

DG TS models the canonical electronic exchange core underlying modern venues such as NASDAQ, MICEX, CME, Euronext, and leading Alternative Trading System platforms.

DG TS implements a canonical continuous double auction market, equivalent at the core level to MICEX and NASDAQ, differing only in configuration and extensions

DG TS models the market physics common to MICEX and NASDAQ. Everything else is configuration or extension.

DG TS is not a clone of MICEX or NASDAQ. It is a canonical abstraction of the exchange core they both implement, modeled as a multi-agent differential game in which the evolution of the order book constitutes the system dynamics, agents act as strategic controllers, and market prices arise endogenously from equilibrium-seeking interactions under explicit information and time constraints.
